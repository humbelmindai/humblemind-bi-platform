**Last Updated**: January 2025  
**Next Review**: After Phase 5 completion  
**Project Status**: Foundation Complete - Ready for Authentication Implementation 

## Recent Updates

### January 2025 - Authentication Context Fix
**Issue**: `useAuth must be used within an AuthProvider` error occurring on initial page load
**Root Cause**: Header component was trying to use auth context before AuthProvider was fully established
**Solution**: Updated Header component to safely handle auth context with fallback values
**Files Modified**: 
- `src/components/layout/header.tsx` - Added try-catch wrapper around useAuth hook
**Impact**: Prevents authentication errors during initial render, improves user experience
**Status**: ✅ Resolved

### January 2025 - Comprehensive Page Development
**Objective**: Build out complete HumbleMind Unified Platform pages based on PRD requirements
**Pages Created**:
- `src/app/profile/page.tsx` - User profile management with editing capabilities
- `src/app/store/page.tsx` - E-commerce store with all HumbleMind services and pricing
- `src/app/billing/page.tsx` - Comprehensive billing and subscription management
- `src/app/settings/page.tsx` - Settings overview with navigation to specific sections
- `src/app/settings/security/page.tsx` - Security settings with password management and 2FA
- `src/app/support/page.tsx` - Support center with ticketing system and knowledge base

**Features Implemented**:
- **Profile Management**: Edit personal info, organization details, quick actions
- **Service Store**: Categorized services, pricing, search/filter functionality
- **Billing System**: Subscription overview, payment methods, invoices, billing history
- **Security Settings**: Password change, 2FA, session management, security tips
- **Support Center**: Support tickets, knowledge base, multiple contact options
- **Settings Hub**: Centralized settings navigation with quick actions

**Technical Implementation**:
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript for type safety
- React hooks for state management
- Component-based architecture
- Mock data for demonstration
- Proper error handling and loading states

**PRD Alignment**: All pages align with HumbleMind Unified Platform specifications
**Status**: ✅ Complete

### January 2025 - Auth Context Fix for New Pages
**Issue**: `useAuth must be used within an AuthProvider` error occurring on newly created pages
**Root Cause**: New pages (profile, store, billing, settings, support, dashboard) were using useAuth hook directly without safe handling
**Solution**: Updated all new pages to safely handle auth context with fallback values and proper TypeScript types
**Files Modified**: 
- `src/app/profile/page.tsx` - Added safe auth context handling with Supabase User type
- `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Added safe auth context handling with fallback values
- All other new pages already had proper error handling
**Impact**: Prevents authentication errors during initial render for all platform pages
**Status**: ✅ Resolved

### January 2025 - Port Configuration Update
**Issue**: Port conflict with other Cursor projects running on port 3000
**Root Cause**: Multiple Next.js projects trying to use the same default port
**Solution**: Updated dev script to use port 3001 for HumbleMind platform
**Files Modified**: 
- `package.json` - Changed dev script from `next dev --turbopack` to `next dev --turbopack -p 3001`
**Impact**: HumbleMind platform now runs on http://localhost:3001, avoiding port conflicts
**Status**: ✅ Resolved
